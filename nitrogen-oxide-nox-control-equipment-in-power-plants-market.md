<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Nitrogen Oxide (NOx) Control Equipment in Power Plants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>LNB</li><li>SCR</li><li>SNCR</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Nitrogen Oxide (NOx) control equipment in power plants primarily includes Low NOx Burners (LNB), Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR), and Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction (SNCR). LNB technologies reduce NOx emissions during combustion by optimizing fuel-air mixing. SCR uses catalysts and a reductant, typically ammonia, to convert NOx into harmless nitrogen and water. SNCR also employs ammonia but does so without a catalyst, injecting it directly into the flue gas at high temperatures, making it a cost-effective option for NOx reduction.</p></p>

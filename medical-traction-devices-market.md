<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical Traction Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Skeletal Traction Devices</li><li>Skin Traction Devices</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The medical traction devices market is primarily categorized into skeletal traction devices and skin traction devices. Skeletal traction devices involve the application of a pulling force directly to the bone using pins or wires, allowing for precise alignment of fractures and relief from muscle spasms. In contrast, skin traction devices utilize adhesive straps or wraps to distribute the pulling force across the skin, providing support and stabilization for bone alignment without invasive intervention. Both types serve crucial roles in orthopedic treatment.</p></p>

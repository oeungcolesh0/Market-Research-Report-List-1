<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ultrasonic Scaler Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Magnetostrictive Ultrasonic Scaler</li><li>Piezoelectric Ultrasonic Scaler</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The ultrasonic scaler market comprises two primary types: magnetostrictive and piezoelectric ultrasonic scalers. Magnetostrictive scalers utilize a metal stack or coil that vibrates, creating ultrasonic waves for effective plaque removal. They are known for their versatility but can produce more heat. Piezoelectric scalers, on the other hand, use piezoelectric crystals to generate vibrations and are generally quieter and more efficient, offering precision in scaling procedures. Both types are widely used in dental practices for periodontal treatment and preventive care.</p></p>
